                        <h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
                        <p>Your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to Shping. This public privacy
                            policy (or privacy statement) explains what personal data we process, how we collect it and why. We take
                            the security of your data very seriously and this privacy policy tells you what we do to ensure its protection.
                            In this policy we also outline the rights we think you have with your personal data, and how you can
                            exercise them.</p>
                        <h3>2. WHO WE ARE</h3>
                        <p>Shping is a world-first integrated shopper marketing, brand protection, product safety and global product
                            database rolled into a single ecosystem that rewards consumers for using it and contributing to it.</p>
                        <p>
                            Shping operates a smartphone application (
                            <b>app</b>) whereby consumers can retrieve and obtain product related information by scanning the product’s
                            barcode. The app may provide additional services for selected products (if available), including but
                            not limited to, authenticity checks, product recall notifications, verification of product recall status,
                            providing product related information, warranty activation, receipt storage, social media integration
                            with participating brands, product rating and feedback and the ability for users to upload product information
                            to Shping’s product database, together with such other services as Shping may introduce from time to
                            time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            App users may also be able to earn rewards, known as
                            <b>Shping Coins</b> for particular actions performed while using the app and we collect information from
                            you so we can transfer these coins to your digital wallet. We are also able to assist you with the purchase
                            and sale of Shping Coins and do to so we will collect personal data including financial information about
                            you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our headquarters are in Melbourne, Australia.
                        </p>
                        <h3>3. OUR APPROACH TO PRIVACY</h3>
                        <p>
                            We do not sell your personal data to third parties for marketing or promotional purposes unless we have your express consent.
                            We do not abuse or misuse your personal data, or let it fall into the wrong hands. We only collect or
                            process your information for the reasons we say we do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a business, we obtain personal data from app users and owners of Shping Coins to provide our services. We obtain personal
                            data when you sign up for the app and any of Shping’s services. The information Shping collects is what
                            you tell Shping about yourself and information about how you use Shping’s app and services, such as what
                            personal information you tell Shping about yourself in creating an account including your phone number
                            and street address, your IP address and location.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When you use the app or this website, Shping automatically receives and records information on its server logs from your
                            browser or mobile platform, including your location, IP address, cookie information, and the page you
                            requested. To best manage information such as location data, you may disable the tracking functionalities
                            on your smartphone device, although the app and our services to you will not operate to their full capacity
                            if you do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also, if you contact Shping, Shping may keep a record of that correspondence. Shping may also draw upon this information
                            in order to adapt the Services to your needs, to research the effectiveness of Shping’s network and services,
                            and to develop new tools for the Services. Where possible, Shping endeavour to limit the collection of
                            your personal data. Shping asks that you update Shping if your personal data details change.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We share your personal information with our business partners in order to provide our services to you. They have their own
                            privacy policies that apply to your information and must be able to provide you with a copy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Technology, laws or even our way of doing business can change from time to time, as can your rights and expectations. To
                            ensure we comply with data protection regulations, we will update this privacy policy. When we make changes,
                            we will always publish it here on our website.
                        </p>

                        <h3>9. SECURITY</h3>
                        <p>We have what we believe are robust, appropriate and sufficient security controls in place to protect personal
                            data. Risk assessment, including assessing risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, is at the
                            heart of our Information security management system. Although even with that, we have no control over
                            what happens between your smartphone device and our information infrastructure. You should be aware of
                            the many cyber security risks that exist and take appropriate steps to safeguard your own information.</p>
                        <p>We accept no liability in respect of breaches that occur beyond our sphere of control. However, we take the
                            privacy and protection of your personal information very seriously and use a number of methods to try
                            to keep your personal information secure from loss or unauthorised use or access when it is in our possession
                            or control. These methods include reasonable physical, technical and organisational measures to restrict
                            access to your personal information. Access to your data (for example amongst our employees and our product
                            partners) is strictly controlled by a combination of secure passwords, permissions-based user roles,
                            tried and tested processes, multi factor authentication and more.</p>
                        <p>
                            Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our website and/or
                            apps, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. You should never share a password with
                            anyone and you should ensure that you do not reuse or recycle passwords.
                        </p>
                        <p>Where required by applicable law, we will notify you of any loss of or unauthorised access to your personal
                            information, and we will cooperate with the appropriate authorities to investigate such incidents in
                            a timely fashion.</p>
                        <h3>10. INTERNATIONAL TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION</h3>
                        <p>We are a global company which provides services globally. As such your personal information may be transferred
                            and stored in locations outside of Australia and where privacy laws may not be as protective as they
                            are in Australia. Our product partners may also operate in such locations and may require that we transfer
                            your personal information to them in those locations.</p>
                        <p>We take steps to try to ensure that your personal information is kept secure regardless of its location,
                            in compliance with applicable laws. Your consent to this privacy policy followed by your submission of
                            any personal information to us represents your agreement and consent to that transfer.</p>
                        <h3>11. RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                        <p>We keep your personal information for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected.
                            This purpose is usually for one of the two reasons as listed above in the section on our legal basis
                            to process your data, namely to help you or to carry out our obligations of a contract. In most cases,
                            this will be the duration of a particular meeting, event, project or campaign for which our product partners
                            have asked us to collect and process information about you. However, we are subject to our product partners’
                            instructions and they may ask us to retain it for longer or to delete it sooner. We regularly audit the
                            information we hold to ensure that it remains relevant to our current requirements and those of our product
                            partners.
                        </p>
                        <p>We maintain a permanent record of anonymized location, demographic and survey data. This data is used to
                            produce aggregated consumer insights and cannot be used to identify individuals.</p>
                        <h3>12. MINORS</h3>
                        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information or data of minors under 16 years of age. We have no control
                            over who contacts us but we do not conduct business with anyone under 16 years of age. For our product
                            partners, if they are using our products and services to collect or process data of children, then they
                            must comply with the data protection laws applicable to them. In those circumstances, our product partners
                            may be obliged to obtain express consent from the children’s parents or legal guardians prior to the
                            use of our service.</p>
                        <h3>13. YOUR RIGHTS</h3>

                                you as well as the following;

                                you, you may exercise your right to correct or complete it. This may be used in conjunction with
                                the right to restrict processing (see below) to make sure that incorrect or incomplete information
                                is not processed until it has been rectified.</li>

                                <b>The right to erasure.</b> Often referred to as the ‘right to be forgotten’. Where no overriding legal
                                basis or legitimate reason continues to exist for processing your personal information, you have
                                the right to request that we delete that data. We will always take all reasonable steps to ensure
                                the erasure or deletion of your data.</li>

                                to the right to erasure. If any of the following conditions apply, then you may exercise your right
