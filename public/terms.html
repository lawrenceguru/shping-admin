                        <p>4.1 You may earn Shping Coins by scanning products (consistently with your obligations under this agreement) and by interacting with the app in other ways and as otherwise indicated the app, as explained below.</p>
                        <p>4.2 When you earn Shping Coins they are first stored in a shared transit account. This account is owned and controlled by Shping and tracks your Shping Coin entitlements.</p>
                        <p>4.3 you may withdraw your coins by moving them to your personal ERC20 wallet. When transferring Shping Coins the user incurs a fee called “GAS”. The GAS fee is paid to the Etherium blockchain platform to update the ownership records of the Shping Coins.</p>
                        <p>4.4 You may transfer Shping Coins to your own ERC20 digital wallet. Each transfer from the Shping Transit account to your own digital wallet will incur a fee. Such a fee may need to be paid by the user in ETH cryptocurrency or
                            may be deducted in equivalent Shping Coin amount based on the exchange rate available to Shping. If fee is deducted from the amount transferred, then the amount received would be less then the amount requested to be transferred.
                            Shping or its affiliates or business partners are not responsible for the security of Shping Coins while they are stored on Shping transit account or while they are transferred to your own wallet at your request. You are held

                        <p>4.5 While keeping coins in the transit account Shping may provide you with additional benefits. For example, Shping may upgrade your tier status and/or allow you to spend or donate your Shping Coins to other System or app users.
                            While Shping takes all the necessary measures to keep the transit account secure, you acknowledge that there is risk of hacking or theft to the account. In order to reduce this risk, we encourage you to keep
                            Shping Coins in your own personal wallet. Should Shping Coins be stolen form the transit account the amount stolen will be deducted from all users balances on an equal basis.</p>
                        <p>4.6 You may leverage integration of Shping with one or a number of Cryptocurrency exchanges and when available in your area to request Shping to list your earned Shping Coins on your behalf on a Cryptocurrency exchange at
                            the highest bit available at the time of the listing, Shping will list your Shping Coins and would request to exchange them for the currency of your choice if that currency is also supported by that exchange and further
                            request that exchange to transfer you the received proceeds from such sale. You accept that described exchange of your Shping Coins is subject to the terms and conditions of the relevant Cryptocurrency
                            exchanges https://blockbid.io/terms and https://cobinhood.com/terms. Shping may also provide you with the terms and conditions of other Cryptocurrency exchanges used in relation to such sales and may apply monthly limits to the dollar value of such sales.</p>

                            and conditions of the Cryptocurrency exchange in relation to this sale. Further, if required by KYC or AML regulation, Shping will provide information about you to those or other relevant regulatory organisations.</p>

Limiting the app’s to access to your Device may result in your participation in Shping Coins program being suspended.

Shping disclaims all responsibility for any failed scanning experiences or errors or mistakes occurring during a scanning attempt.</p>
                        <p>4.13 Shping and its affiliates or business partners from time to time may also provide various other ways for you to earn Shping Coins, for example, providing, adding or correcting information or feedback in relation to scanned products, adding new products and product information to the app, having added products or related information viewed by other users, completing product surveys, watching videos or interacting with social media via the app (such as following participating brands or products).

                        <p>4.15 By participating in these programs, you agree that the app may access information about the action you take within the app, such as the video you watch or the survey to which you respond, or which items you intend to buy or have bought, and other relevant information.

In addition, as applicable, you agree that the app may access your phone or device’ s camera and that Shping and its vendors, partners, and clients may review the submissions made by your device. you agree to use the app and these programs only for the actions required.</p>
                        <p>4.16 Shping is not liable for any failure to award Shping Coins, including due to the inaccuracy of the information Shping may receive from participating product suppliers or because of a Shping Coins or other awards allocation having previously been fully distributed to other account holders. you agree that Shping is under no obligation to notify you when an allocation of Shping Coins for distribution under this program has reached a zero balance for any given product, and Shping Coins will be distributed on a “first come, first served” basis.</p>

Allow 30 days for any claims to be researched and corrected as needed. Shping’ s determination will be final. Shping cannot guarantee that Shping Coins or other awards you believe should have been accrued can be credited to you later, if Shping cannot determine the precise location you were in, or the action you took on the app at the time when you believe the Shping Coins or other awards should have been credited. Among other reasons, technical problems with a walk-in or scanning system or verification of transaction information may result in your action not being detected or verified accurately by the app. Neither Shping nor its affiliates or business partners can be held liable for your inability to accrue Shping Coins or other awards in such event.</p>
